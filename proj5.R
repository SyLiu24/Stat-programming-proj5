# The project aims to obtain an excess deaths time series from 2020 onwards and
# analyze the series.

# Excess deaths are the number of deaths over some time, relative to
# what would have been expected given some data from previous period.
# We will first implement a demographic model for England and Wales to generate
# the expected deaths.
# Considering death rates have a seasonal pattern and the ageing process, 
# we build a model with 101 age classes - N_i, i=1,...,101 to represent the
# population in age 0 to age 100, and update N_i by week, to get the expected 
# number of deaths per week. For each age class we have the instantaneous per 
# capita death rate per year m_i. In the absence of seasonality, the expected
# proportion of N_i dying in a week is q_i=1-e^{-m_i/52}. To allow for seasonal
# variation d_j in mortality rates, the proportion dying is d_jq_i in week j.
# So for week j, applying the dying and ageing process, the model becomes
# D_i = d_jq_iN_i, N^*_i = N_i-D_i, N^+_i = 51N^*_i/52+N^*_{i-1}/52, i=1,...,101
# If N_i is the population in age class i at the start of week j, then D_i is 
# the number of deaths for class i, and N^+_i is the population in class i at
# the start of week j+1. Assuming a constant birth rate, we set N^*_0 to the
# initial value of age 0 class, i.e. N^*_0 is always set the value of N_1 at
# the start of simulation. And changing to D_i=0.9885d_jq_iN_i reduces
# the crudeness of the model. Summing up the D_i over age classes we get the
# expected deaths each week. And since m_i is rather different between sexes,
# model will be run separately for each sex and the resulting weekly expected
# deaths summed.
# We iterate this model with the populations from 2020 and the death rates from
# 2017-2019 to predict the expected deaths from 2020 if death rates had stayed
# the same as previous 3 years. Then compare this to the actual deaths per week
# from 2020 to obtain the excess deaths time series. The annual death rates and
# populations of of each age group data are available from the Office for 
# National Statistics (ONS).
# We then then model this series x_i, excess deaths for week i, using a simple
# Bayesian model
# mu_1=alpha, mu_{i+1}=(x_i-alpha)rho+alpha, x_i~t_k(mu_i,tau), i=1,...,n.
# t_k(mu_i,tau) denotes a scaled t distribution with mean mu_i ,precision tau
# and k degrees of freedom. Priors tau~exp(1), rho~U(0,0.9),
# alpha~N(0,tau=0.0001) and k~U(2,100).
# We implement the model in JAGS and draw samples from the posterior densities
# of mu vector, rho and k given x_i data to highlight the parts of the series
# that are most unusual. Note that we will not use x_i for weeks 51, 52, 53, 105
# and 106 for inference as these are Christmas/New Year data with various 
# recording problems.
